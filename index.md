## Welcome To The _Machine Learning Discussion Group!_
# It's Nice To Meet You

### Mission
We're a group of students of all levels (Bachelor, Master, PhD) from TU Darmstadt, Germany.
Our mission is to foster a culture of discussion in the field of machine learning at TU Darmstadt.

### Skill Level
Most of the pariticipants have at least a small background in ML.
Nevertheless, everyone who wants to learn about ML is welcome.

### What exactly do we talk about?
We read conference papers, tutorials, book chapters, YouTube-videos, and whatever is helpful to understand the matter.

### How to know what will be discussed?
The paper for the upcoming session will be named on this webpage.
Please be aware that no file access will be provided. Although a huge amount of papers is freely available, e.g. via [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), some papers have limited access, e.g. you have free access to the ACM Digital Library as a student of TU Darmstadt.

### How do we communicate?
Currently, we use the following Slack channel:
https://tudmachinelearning.slack.com/
However, you only get access if you own a `@...tu-darmstadt.de` email address.
If you aren't university member, please 

### When and where do we meet?
We meet on Monday evening, 6pm. The location changes, so if you're not a member of the university, please, get in touch with us and we'll tell you where you have to go.
